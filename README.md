**Data Cleaning:**
--- sql
Convert date and time to correct format
UPDATE coffee_shop_sales
SET transaction_date = STR_TO_DATE(transaction_date, '%d-%m-%Y');

ALTER TABLE coffee_shop_sales
MODIFY COLUMN transaction_date DATE; ---

KPI Calculations:
-- Total Sales
SELECT ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) AS Total_Sales
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) = 5;

-- MoM Growth
SELECT 
    MONTH(transaction_date) AS month,
    ROUND(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty)) AS total_sales,
    (SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty) - LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1)
    OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date))) / LAG(SUM(unit_price * transaction_qty), 1)
    OVER (ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date)) * 100 AS mom_increase_percentage
FROM coffee_shop_sales
WHERE MONTH(transaction_date) IN (4, 5)
GROUP BY MONTH(transaction_date)
ORDER BY MONTH(transaction_date);
